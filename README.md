# Machine Learning Repository

Welcome to my Machine Learning repository! This project is a collection of implementations, datasets, and small projects focused on understanding and applying Machine Learning (ML) concepts. The repository is divided into several folders for better organization and usability.

## Repository Structure

- **[Algos_From_Scratch/](Algos_From_Scratch/)**
  - Contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms coded from scratch in Python.
  - Focused on building a deep understanding of how ML algorithms work under the hood.
  - Algorithms included (but not limited to):
    - Linear Regression
    - Logistic Regression
    - Decision Trees
    - Naive Bayes
    - K-Nearest Neighbors
    - Support Vector Machines
    - Perceptron

- **[Datasets/](Datasets/)**
  - Includes datasets used for testing, training, and experimenting with ML models.
    
- **[Small_Projects/](Small_Projects/)**
  - A collection of small, focused projects that demonstrate the application of ML techniques.
  - Project on Polynomial LinearRegression

- **[Libraries/](Libraries/)**
  -Exploratory Data analysis with Numpy,Matplotlib and Pandas
